## Description

As the name implies, this is my personal portfolio/website. Fully responsive, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and cluttered with interactive, self-made, custom CSS animations. It includes a little bit about me, my projects, past experiences, and has been curated to really mirror my vibrant, yet quiet, personality.
